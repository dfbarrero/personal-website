Improved life expectancy should be welcomed as a major achievement, but it should not cause a financial or social burden. In this scenario, it is critical to support older and handicap adults to continue living independently and retaining their current lifestyle. New technological advances in Wireless Sensors Networks (WSN) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can facilitate this task. In this direction we present lares, an AI-based system that integrates a (i) WSN for receiving information of the environment and the dependent person, (ii) an autonomous robot able to take decisions based on the received information, and (iii) a Web-based system to provide telecare assistance. lares has been tried in two dependent elderly home environments during several weeks, and the experiments show that is able to detect anomalies and generate alarms in abnormal situations."

    abstract="Autonomous control in robotics hold promising solutions for a broad number of applications. However, autonomous controllers require highly expertise on heterogeneous technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence Planning {\&} Scheduling, behaviour modelling, intelligent execution and the hardware to control. Connecting these technologies entails several challenges to properly synchronize and verify the robot behaviours to deal with real scenarios. In this article, we present an autonomous controller based on high level modelling to easily enable adaptation of the controller to different robotics platforms and application domains. This controller, called MoBAr, allows on-board planning and replanning for goal oriented autonomy. It relies on technologies such as PLEXIL to model the execution behaviours, or the action oriented planning language PDDL for the domain definition and the planning process. Based on these technologies MoBAr enables an easier deployment of the autonomous controller for different robotics platforms. Moreover, MoBAr enables researching in planning systems applied to robotics domains, as it is possible to replace the PDDL planner and/or domain used without much effort. This fact is demonstrated in the experimental section, in which we demonstrate the adaptability and effectiveness of the controller in three different scenarios, i.e., a robotic arm, an office surveillance robot and an exploration rover while exploiting different planning systems.",

A relevant aspect of such planning are the paths that the rover has to to follow to reach the scientific objectives. For path planning, operators use a combination of orbital and surface imagery to analyze the terrain topography to generate a cost map. Applying path planning algorithms over the cost map it is possible to obtain (sub)optimal solutions to safely drive the rover through different waypoints. As well, the paths obtained can be assessed using simulators and handmade improved by means of Virtual Reality techniques. In this paper we present an integrated planner for the mission planning and its evaluation using the recent technological advances in Virtual Reality. We have developed a low cost application to provide a three-dimensional view of the path generated exploiting real Mars surfaces with the aim of helping operators in deciding the best paths to follow.},

Thus, several solutions have been proposed to detect falls, however, none of them achieved a great success mainly because of the need of wearing a recording device. In this paper, we study the use of sound to detect fall events. The advantage of this approach over the traditional ones is that the subject does not require to wear additional devices to monitor his or her activities. Here, we apply machine learning techniques to process sound simulated the most common type of fall for the elderly, i.e., when the foot collides with an obstacle and the trunk hits the ground before using his/her hands to absorb the fall. The results show that high levels of accuracy can be achieved using only a few signal processing techniques.}

They exploit some properties of random numbers to quantify to what extent the observed behavior of the tested sequence approximates the expected one. Given the many sides of randomness, there is not an unique test providing the whole picture, instead a suite of tests assessing different aspects randomness. A robust test suite must include independent tests, otherwise tests would assess the same property, providing redundant information. This paper addresses the independence assessment of a popular test suite named Ent. To this end we generate a large number of pseudo-random numbers with different degrees of randomness by evolving them with a Genetic Algorithm. The numbers are generated to maximize their diversity attending different criteria based on Ent output, used as fitness. We encourage diversity by maximizing and minimizing randomness measures. Once a diverse set of pseudo-random numbers is generated, the Ent test suite is run on them, and their statistics studied by means of a classical correlation analysis. The results show high correlation among some statistics used in the literature, which could be overestimating the quality of their randomness source."

All the most widespread, successful or interesting CAPTCHA designs put to scrutiny have been successfully broken. Many of these attacks have been side-channel attacks. New designs are proposed to tackle these security problems while improving the human interface. FunCAPTCHA is the first commercial implementation of a gender classification CAPTCHA, with reported improvements in conversion rates. This article finds weaknesses in the security of FunCAPTCHA and uses simple machine learning (ML) analysis to test them. It shows a side-channel attack that leverages these flaws and successfully solves FunCAPTCHA on 90\% of occasions without using meaningful image analysis. This simple yet effective security analysis can be applied with minor modifications to other HIPs proposals, allowing to check whether they leak enough information that would in turn allow for simple side-channel attacks.}

Some of these environments are controllable and well-defined, and the tasks to be performed are generally everyday ones. However, exploration missions also enclose hard constraints such as driving vehicles to many locations in a surface of several kilometres to collect and/or analyse interesting samples. Therefore, a critical aspect for the mission is to optimally (or sub-optimally) plan the path that a robot should follow while performing scientific tasks. In this paper, we present up2ta, a new AI planner that interleaves path-planning and task-planning for mobile robotics applications. The planner is the result of integrating a modified PDDL planner with a path-planning algorithm, combining domain-independent heuristics and a domain-specific heuristic for path-planning. Then, up2ta can exploit capabilities of both planners to generate shorter paths while performing scientific tasks in an efficient ordered way. The planner has been tested in two domains: an exploration mission consisting of pictures acquisition, and a more challenging one that includes samples delivering. Also, up2ta has been integrated and tested in a real robotic platform for both domains.}

There is an ongoing effort to find a HIP that is secure enough yet easy for humans. Recently, a new HIP has been designed aiming at higher security: the Civil Rights Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). It employs the empathy capacity of humans to further strengthen Securimage, a well-known text CAPTCHA. In this paper, we analyze it from a security perspective, finding fundamental design flaws. Using several well-known machine learning (ML) algorithms, we analyze to what extent these flaws affect its security. We discover that thanks to them, we can create a successful side-channel attack. This attack is able to correctly solve the HIP on 20.7\% of occasions, much more than enough to consider it broken. Thus, we show that there is no need to solve the problem of optical character recognition nor empathy analysis for computers to break this particular HIP. ML can be successfully used to break a HIP that uses both with a side-channel attack. This security analysis can be applied to other HIPs. It will allow to test whether they are leaking too much information by unexpected ways, given non-evident design flaws.}

One popular measure used by the EC community is the success rate (SR), which is used alone or as part of more complex measures such as Koza’s computational effort in genetic programming. A common practice in EC is to report just a punctual estimation of the SR, without additional information about its associated uncertainty. We aim to motivate EC researchers to adopt more rigorous practices when working with SRs. In particular, we introduce the importance of correctly reporting this measure and highlight its binomial nature. Unfortunately, this fact is usually overlooked in the literature. Considering the binomiality of the SR opens the whole corpus of binomial statistics to EA research and practice. In particular, we focus on studying several methods to compute SR confidence intervals, the factors that determine their quality in terms of coverage probability and interval length. Due to its practical interest, we also briefly discuss the number of required runs to build confidence intervals with a certain quality, providing a sound method to set the number of runs, one of the most important experimental settings in EC. Evidence suggests that Wilson is, on average, a reliable and simple method to bound an estimation of SR with confidence intervals, while the standard method, which is quite popular because of its conceptual simplicity, should be avoided in any case. However, other methods can also be of interest under certain circumstances. We encourage to report the number of trials and successes, as well as the interval, to ease further comparability of the results.}

    abstract = {The logistic sector raises a number of highly challenging problems. Probably one of the most important ones is the shipping planning, i.e. plan the routes that the shippers have to follow to deliver the goods. In this article, we present an artificial intelligence-based solution that has been designed to help a logistic company to improve its routes planning process. In order to achieve this goal, the solution uses the knowledge acquired by the company drivers to propose optimised routes. Hence, the proposed solution gathers the experience of the drivers, processes it and optimises the delivery process. The solution uses data mining to extract knowledge from the company information systems and prepares it for analysis with a case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm. The CBR obtains critical business intelligence knowledge from the drivers experience that is needed by the planner. The design of the routes is done by a genetic algorithm that, given the processed information, optimises the routes following several objectives, such as minimise the distance or time. Experimentation shows that the proposed approach is able to find routes that improve, on average, the routes made by the human experts.},

    abstract = {Run-time analysis is a method that characterizes the run-time behaviour of an algorithm. It has been successfully used to analyse metaheuristics and stochastic local search algorithms. Some studies on genetic programming and related stochastic search algorithms suggested the existence of a rationale behind the run-time behaviour which could be exploited to better understand the algorithm looking at its run-time response. Under that hypothesis, this paper presents empirical evidence suggesting common statistical properties in the run-time of several types of population-based search algorithms, including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, differential evolution or particle swarm optimization. In this analysis, only the run-time of runs that were able to find a solution are considered; unsuccessful runs are not included in the analysis. The run-time to find a solution, measured by the number of evaluations, of some well-known evolutionary algorithms is empirically obtained, finding that it usually can be approximated using a lognormal distribution, with the exception of some difficult problems, which are better approximated by an exponential. We also show that the algorithm parameter settings might influence the yielding run-time statistical distribution; in particular, when there is no selective pressure, the run-time, measured as the number of evaluations to find a solution, follows a Weibull distribution instead of a lognormal one. Finally, we outline a framework using a simple theoretical discrete-time model, showing that the geometrically distributed run-time is a consequence of the lack of memory in the algorithm.},

abstract={Clustering is a field of Data Mining that deals with the problem of extract knowledge from data blindly. Basically, clustering identifies similar data in a dataset and groups them in sets named clusters. The high number of clustering practical applications has made it a fertile research topic with several approaches. One recent method that is gaining popularity in the research community is Spectral Clustering (SC). It is a clustering method that builds a similarity graph and applies spectral analysis to preserve the data continuity in the cluster. This work presents a new algorithm inspired by SC algorithm, the Co-Evolutionary Multi-Objective Genetic Graph-based Clustering (CEMOG) algorithm, which is based on the Multi-Objective Genetic Graph-based Clustering (MOGGC) algorithm and extends it by introducing an adaptative number of clusters. CEMOG takes an island-model approach where each island keeps a population of candidate solutions for ki clusters. Individuals in the islands can migrate to encourage genetic diversity and the propagation of individuals around promising search regions. This new approach shows its competitive performance, compared to several classical clustering algorithms (EM, SC and K-means), through a set of experiments involving synthetic and real datasets.},

These properties have generated a wide range of applications in different areas. Due to economic and technological constrains, RFID devices are seriously limited, having small or even tiny computational capabilities. This issue is particularly challenging from the security point of view. Security protocols in RFID environments have to deal with strong computational limitations, and classical protocols cannot be used in this context. There have been several attempts to overcome these limitations in the form of new lightweight security protocols designed to be used in very constrained (sometimes called ultra-lightweight) RFID environments. One of these proposals is the David-Prasad ultra-lightweight authentication protocol. This protocol was successfully attacked using a cryptanalysis technique named Tango attack. The capacity of the attack depends on a set of boolean approximations. In this paper, we present an enhanced version of the Tango attack, named Genetic Tango attack, that uses Genetic Programming to design those approximations, easing the generation of automatic cryptanalysis and improving its power compared to a manually designed attack. Experimental results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of this new attack.},

Despite the importance of these metrics, and the doubts that they have generated in many authors, their reliability has attracted little research attention, and is still not well understood. The lack of knowledge about these metrics has likely contributed to the decline in their usage in the last years. This paper is an attempt to increase the knowledge about these measures, exploring in which circumstances they are more reliable, providing some clues to improve how they are used, and eventually making their use more justifiable. Specifically, we investigate the amount of uncertainty associated with the measures, taking an analytical and empirical approach and reaching theoretical boundaries to the error. Additionally, a new method to calculate Koza's performance measures is presented. It is shown that these metrics, under common experimental configurations, have an unacceptable error, which can be arbitrary large in certain conditions.}

Given two points in a map, path-planning algorithms search for a path that joins those two points, avoiding obstacles. It is a challenging problem with important practical applications in a wide range of applications: autonomous mobile robotics, logistics or video games, just to mention some of them. Given its importance, it has attracted much research, resulting in a large number of algorithms, some classical, such as A*, other more specialized, such as swarms. However, despite all the literature dedicated to this problem, the statistics used to analyze experimental results in most cases are naïve. In this paper, we position in favor of the need of incorporating stronger statistical methods in path-planning empirical research and promote a debate in the research community. To this end, we analyze some 2D-grid classical path-planning algorithms in discrete domains (i.e. A* and A* with post-processing) and more recent algorithms in continuous domains (i.e. Theta* and S-Theta*). Given the differences of these algorithms, we study them under different criteria: Run-time, number of heading changes, number of expanded vertices and path-length.}

However, research usually focuses on reducing the length of the path or the processing time. The common practice in the literature is to report the run-time/length of the algorithm with means and, sometimes, some dispersion measure. However, this practice has several drawbacks, mainly due to the loose of valuable information that this reporting practice involves such as asymmetries in the run-time, or the shape of its distribution. Run-time analysis is a type of empirical tool that studies the time consumed by running an algorithm. This paper is an attempt to bring this tool to the path-planning community. To this end the paper reports an analysis of the run-time of the path-planning algorithms with a variety of problems of different degrees of complexity, indoors, outdoors and Mars surfaces. We conclude that the time required by these algorithms follows a lognormal distribution.}

In this paper we provide additional evidence in that regard and show how the algorithm parametrization may change the resulting run-time distribution. In particular, we explore the influence of the selective pressure on the run-time distribution in tree-based GP, finding that, at least in two problem instances, the lack of selective pressure generates an expected run-time distribution well described by the Weibull probability distribution.}

  abstract = {Clustering is one of the most versatile tools for data analysis. Over the last few years, clustering that seeks the continuity of data (in opposition to classical centroid-based approaches) has attracted an increasing research interest. It is a challenging problem with a remarkable practical interest. The most popular continuity clustering method is the Spectral Clustering algorithm, which is based on graph cut: it initially generates a Similarity Graph using a distance measure and then uses its Graph Spectrum to find the best cut. Memory consuption is a serious limitation in that algorithm: The Similarity Graph representation usually requires a very large matrix with a high memory cost. This work proposes a new algorithm, based on a previous implementation named Genetic Graph-based Clustering (GGC), that improves the memory usage while maintaining the quality of the solution. The new algorithm, called Multi-Objective Genetic Graph-based Clustering (MOGGC), uses an evolutionary approach introducing a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm to manage a reduced version of the Similarity Graph. The experimental validation shows that MOGGC increases the memory efficiency, maintaining and improving the GGC results in the synthetic and real datasets used in the experiments. An experimental comparison with several classical clustering methods (EM, SC and K-means) has been included to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.}

The individual results are compared to a collective identification result determined by simple majority voting, with random choice in case of drawn. The results are promising, as the identification becomes significantly more reliable even with this simple voting, and with a small number of people (either odd or even) involved in the decision. In addition, the paper briefly analyzes the role of brain-computer interfaces in collaborative targeting, extending the targeting task by using a BCI instead of a mechanical response.}

  abstract = {This paper explores means to increase efficiency in performing tasks with multi-robot teams, in the context of natural Human-Multi-Robot Interfaces (HMRI) for command and control. The motivating scenario is an emergency evacuation by a transport convoy of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) that have to traverse, in shortest time, an unknown terrain. In the experiments the operator commands, in minimal time, a group of rovers through a maze. The efficiency of performing such tasks depends on both, the levels of robots' autonomy, and the ability of the operator to command and control the team. The paper extends the classic framework of levels of autonomy (LOA), to levels/hierarchy of autonomy characteristic of Groups (G-LOA), and uses it to determine new strategies for control. An UGVoriented command language (UGVL) is defined, and a mapping is performed from the human-friendly gesture-based HMRI into the UGVL. The UGVL is used to control a team of 3 robots, exploring the efficiency of different G-LOA; specifically, by (a) controlling each robot individually through the maze, (b) controlling a leader and cloning its controls to followers, and (c) controlling the entire group. Not surprisingly, commands at increased G-LOA lead to a faster traverse, yet a number of aspects are worth discussing in this context.}

This type of analysis has been successfully used in some Artificial Intelligence (AI) fields, in paticular in Metaheuristics. This paper is an attempt to bring this tool to the path-planning community. In particular, we analyse the statistical properties of the run-time of the A*, Theta* and S-Theta* algorithms with a variety of problems of different degrees of complexity. Traditionally, the path-planning literature has compared run-times just comparing their mean values. This practice, which unfortunately is quite common in the literature, raises serious concerns from a methodological and statistical point of view. Simple mean comparison provides poorly supported conclusions, and, in general, it can be said that this practice should be avoided.
			After our analysis, we conclude that the time required by these three algorithms follows a lognormal distribution. In low complexity problems, the lognormal distribution looses some accuracy to describe the algorithm run-times. The lognormality of the run-times opens the use of powerful parametric statistics to compare execution times, which could lead to stronger empirical methods.},

  abstract = {Some commonly used performance measures in Genetic Programming are those defined by John Koza in his first book. These measures, mainly computational effort and number of individuals to be processed, estimate the performance of the algorithm as well as the difficulty of a problem. Although Koza's performance measures have been widely used in the literature, their behaviour is not well known. In this paper we study the accuracy of these measures and advance in the understanding of the factors that influence them. In order to achieve this goal, we report an empirical study that attempts to systematically measure the effects of two variability sources in the estimation of the number of individuals to be processed and the computational effort. The results obtained in those experiments suggests that these measures, in common experimental setups, and under certain circumstances, might have a high relative error.}

  abstract = {The new advances in information communications technology (ICT) allow expanding the electronic communication networks into an objective environment. These techniques can be used to help users who have to go to a building with several floors, corridors, and departments to get its right location and orientation. The problem gets more complicated when there are a high number of visitors with temporal constraints. Typically the lack of information and signs to guide the user complicates this task. A typical example is a hospital, where patients have scheduled doctor's appointments and in some cases movement problems (handicaps). A possibility for solving this problem is to equip the building with an intelligent system for user detection and orientation.

		  In this article we present a solution that uses a detection and a location system based on wireless technology and artificial intelligence techniques to plan and inform about the paths the user can follow.}

The tool combines from the one hand, Case-Based Reasoning techniques to separate and learn the most frequent areas or zones that the experienced logistic operators do. These techniques allow the company to separate the daily incidents that generate noise in the routes, from the decision made based on the knowledge of the route. From the other hand, we have used Evolutionary Computation to plan optimal routes from the learning areas and evaluate those routes. The application allows the users to decide under what parameters (i.e. distance, time, etc) the route should be optimized.}

Although they provide a powerful and flexible notation to define and retrieve patterns from text, the syntax and the grammatical rules of these regex notations are not easy to use, and even to understand. Any regex can be represented as a Deterministic or Non-Deterministic Finite Automata; so it is possible to design a representation to automatically build a regex, and a optimization algorithm able to find the best regex in terms of complexity. This paper introduces both, a graph-based representation for regex, and a particular heuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm based on grammatical features from this language in a particular data extraction problem.}

They are able to efficiently exploit historical information in the evolution process to look for optimal solutions or approximate themfor a given problem, achieving excellent performance in optimization problems that involve a large set of dependent variables. Despite the excellent results of GAs, their use may generate new problems. One of them is how to provide a good fitting in the usually large number of parameters that must be tuned to allow a good performance. This paper describes a new platform that is able to extract the Regular Expression that matches a set of examples, using a supervised learning and agent-based framework. In order to do that, GA-based agents decompose the GA execution in a distributed sequence of operations performed by them. The platform has been applied to Language induction problem, for that reason the experiments are focused on the extraction of the regular expression that matches a set of examples. Finally, the paper shows the efficiency of the proposed platform (in terms of fitness value) applied to three case studies: emails, phone numbers and URLs. Moreover, it is described how the codification of the alphabet affects to the performance of the platform.},
